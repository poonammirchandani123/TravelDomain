Step 1:
This Java Selenium project in the travel domain demonstrates how to automate the key functionalities of a travel booking website. By setting up this project, you gain a practical understanding of using Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, and Maven to create a robust test automation framework.
The goal of this project is to automate the testing of a travel website using Selenium WebDriver in Java. The automation will cover the essential functionalities of a travel booking website, such as searching for flights, selecting a flight, and verifying booking details.
Step 2:
Designing the Test Plan
Define the key functionalities that you want to automate. In this example, we will focus on the following features:

Search for Flights: Enter travel details (source, destination, date) and search for available flights.
Select a Flight: Choose a flight from the search results.
Verify Booking Details: Ensure that the selected flight details are correct on the booking page.
Step 3: Writing Test Cases
Search Flights Test:

Create a new class SearchFlightsTest.java.
Write the test case to search for flights using Selenium WebDriver.
